# BabelScrib Documentation

## Overview

BabelScrib is a simplified, anonymous file upload and translation service built with Django and Azure services. The application allows users to upload documents and translate them using Azure Cognitive Services without requiring authentication.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: No Authentication System

**BabelScrib operates without any authentication or user isolation.** All uploaded files are accessible to all users. This is a public file sharing and translation service.

## Key Features

- üìÅ **Anonymous File Upload**: Upload documents without registration
- üåê **Document Translation**: Translate documents using Azure Cognitive Services
- üì• **Global File Access**: All users can access all uploaded files
- üîÑ **Automatic Cleanup**: Translated files are deleted after download
- üöÄ **Simple Deployment**: No complex authentication configuration required

## Architecture

### Backend Components
- **Django Web Framework**: Handles HTTP requests and responses
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Stores uploaded and translated documents
- **Azure Cognitive Services**: Provides document translation capabilities

### Key Endpoints
- `POST /upload/` - Upload files anonymously
- `POST /translate/` - Translate all uploaded documents
- `GET /download/<filename>/` - Download any file
- `GET /list-files/` - List all uploaded files

### Database Model
```python
class Document(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    file = models.FileField(upload_to='documents/')
    uploaded_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    blob_name = models.CharField(max_length=500)
    is_translated = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    translation_language = models.CharField(max_length=10, blank=True, null=True)
```

## Security Model

### Public Access
- No user authentication required
- All files accessible to all users
- No file ownership or access controls
- Suitable for non-sensitive document translation

### Recommended Security Measures
- Rate limiting on uploads and downloads
- File type and size validation
- Network-level security (CloudFlare, etc.)
- Regular cleanup of old files
- Monitoring and alerting

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables for deployment:

```bash
# Django Settings
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-domain.com

# Azure Storage
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=your-connection-string
AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME_SOURCE=source
AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME_TARGET=target

# Azure Translation
AZURE_TRANSLATION_KEY=your-translation-key
AZURE_TRANSLATION_ENDPOINT=your-translation-endpoint
AZURE_TRANSLATION_SOURCE_URI=your-source-uri
AZURE_TRANSLATION_TARGET_URI=your-target-uri
```

## Quick Start

1. **Set Environment Variables**: Configure all required Azure and Django settings
2. **Run Migrations**: `python manage.py migrate`
3. **Start Server**: `python manage.py runserver`
4. **Upload Files**: Use the web interface to upload documents
5. **Translate**: Use the translation feature to translate documents
6. **Download**: Download translated files (they're automatically cleaned up)

## Use Cases

This implementation is suitable for:
- Public document translation services
- Internal corporate tools with trusted users
- Demonstration or development environments
- Services where document privacy is not a concern

## Migration History

BabelScrib was originally designed with user authentication and file isolation. The authentication system has been completely removed to simplify deployment and operation. See `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` for details on this major refactor.
